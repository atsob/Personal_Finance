Background scheduler — runs as a separate Docker service (see docker-compose.yml).

Jobs
────
• Market data       : every MARKET_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES (24 × 7).
                      Downloads the latest prices for all securities and FX rates.
• Daily backup      : 06:00 AM — pg_dump + retention purge.
• Morning maint.    : 06:15 AM — VACUUM ANALYZE + full embedding update.
• Weekly summary    : Monday 07:00 — also fires at startup if missing for this week.
• Securities info   : once per calendar day (at startup).
